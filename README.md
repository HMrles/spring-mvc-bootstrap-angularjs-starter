spring-mvc-bootstrap-angularjs-starter
======================================

The purpose of this is to serve as a project base that has the following things built in:
* Maven project structure and configuration
* Spring MVC and default mappings
* Bootstrap resources and starter page
* AngularJS resources and starter page
* Application defaults like logging, exception handling, and login.

This doesn't really do anything yet and is a work in progress as I kick project code back upstream to it.  Feel free to fork and send pull requests though.
